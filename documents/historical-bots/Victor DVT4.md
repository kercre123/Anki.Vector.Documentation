# Victor DVT4

"Victor DVT4" prototypes are the last of the Design Validation Test batches for Vector.

These look just like production Vectors, and the circutry is final.

There are a couple software differences though:

* No unlock OTA have been found for a DVT4.
* Many are prod locked, and can only download firmwares like 0.10. We don't have these OTAs.

The body board in these are normal and can be used as a replacement for a normal Vector.

These have serial numbers following this format: 00e1####

Some of these bots may boot up to an exclaimation point. Turning them upside-down then double (or triple) pressing the button will let them finish bootup. Then, you can shake them around to make them explore around.
