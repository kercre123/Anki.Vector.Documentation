# Software error codes

If something has gone wrong, an error will appear on Vector's face. The ones on this page are (usually) software.

914-915

* There was an issue with vic-engine. Vector should restart to normal operation on his own.

913

* There was an issue with vic-switchboard. This could happen if there was an error in BLE communication or if you entered too long of a string into the SDK. He should restart fine.

916-917

* There was an issue with vic-robot. He should restart just fine.

800

* There was an issue with vic-anim. He should restart just fine. If he doesn't, restart into recovery and clear user data.

850-852

* There was an issue with the cloud and/or serial number. A clear user data may help.

920-921

* There was an issue with vic-gateway or vic-gateway-cert. If he is stuck on this, you may need to clear user data.

923

* Vic-cloud has crashed. He should restart fine. If you got an 801-899 error before, this may be the server's fault.
