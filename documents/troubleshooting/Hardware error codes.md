# Hardware error codes

If something has gone wrong, an error will appear on Vector's face. These error happen if Vector's hardware is bad, but some of them could also be software.

801

* Rampost was unable to communicate with the body board at boot. This will show up before an 898 or 899 error. If the board shows just a purple light and won't turn off, you need to wait for his battery to die. After that, turn him back on. If there is still a purple light, there could be a hardware issue with the body board.

870-895

* Body board has a specific hardware fault.

898

* There was an error when trying to communicate with the body board. If the board shows just a purple light and won't turn off, you need to wait for his battery to die. After that, turn him back on. If there is still a purple light, there could be a hardware issue with the body board.

899

* The firmware was unable to find the body. If the board shows just a purple light and won't turn off, you need to wait for his battery to die. After that, turn him back on. If there is still a purple light, there could be a hardware issue with the body board.

970

* The Wi-Fi hardware failed.

980-981
